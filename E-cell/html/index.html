        <h2>What is Electrochemistry?</h2>
        <p>Electrochemistry is the study of chemical processes that cause electrons to move. This movement of electrons is called electricity, which can be generated by movements of electrons from one element to another in a reaction known as an oxidation-reduction ("redox") reaction.</p>

        <h2>3-Electrode Setup</h2>
        <p>A three-electrode setup is commonly used in electrochemical experiments to study electrode processes. It consists of a working electrode, a reference electrode, and a counter electrode.</p>
