## Quick Implementation Guide for Future AI Developers:

To implement the Muza design system on a new page:

1. **Include the CSS:**

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

2. **Add required HTML elements:**

```html
<canvas class="mesh-background" id="meshCanvas"></canvas>
<button class="theme-toggle" id="themeToggle">◐ DARK</button>
```

3. **Include the JavaScript:**

```html
<script src="muza-script.js"></script>
```

4. **That's it!** The system will automatically:
   - Initialize the animated mesh background
   - Set up theme switching with persistence
   - Add scroll animations to cards
   - Handle all responsive behaviors

The JavaScript file is thoroughly documented with JSDoc comments explaining:

- What each function does
- Parameter types and purposes
- Performance considerations
- Customization options

This modular approach makes it incredibly easy for any developer (human or AI) to understand, maintain, and extend the system!
