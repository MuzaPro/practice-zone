# Haptic Navigation System: Technical Summary for Development Team

## Overview
This paper presents a breakthrough wireless haptic interface system designed for sensory substitution, particularly for visually impaired navigation. The core innovation is an array of "bistable" haptic transducers that use the user's own skin as an energy storage mechanism, enabling efficient, multi-modal tactile feedback.

## Core Haptic Transducer Technology

### Bistable Operation Principle
Each transducer operates on a unique "bioelastic" principle where:
- **Skin acts as a spring**: The device compresses the user's skin and stores mechanical energy
- **Two stable states**: "Relaxed" (skin uncompressed) and "Compressed" (skin indented ~2mm)
- **Energy recovery**: Transitions between states recover stored energy from skin elasticity
- **Low power consumption**: Only requires energy during state transitions, not to maintain positions

### Multi-Modal Stimulation
The transducers deliver three distinct types of haptic feedback:

1. **Static Indentation**: 
   - Normal force pressing into skin (up to 1.4N, >2mm displacement)
   - Targets slowly-adapting (SA) mechanoreceptors
   - Used for sustained directional cues

2. **Dynamic Vibration**:
   - Oscillating stimulation at 5-400 Hz frequency range
   - Can vibrate in either relaxed or compressed state
   - Targets rapidly-adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors
   - Used for attention-grabbing alerts

3. **Shear/Torsion Forces**:
   - Tangential forces via novel "kirigami" origami-like structures
   - Up to 14° rotation between contacting elements
   - Provides directional information through skin stretching

### Self-Sensing and Adaptive Control
- **Inductance-based sensing**: Each transducer monitors its own position
- **Closed-loop control**: Adapts to individual skin mechanical properties
- **Energy optimization**: Tailors power consumption based on real-time sensing

## Array Configuration and Integration

### Physical Layout
- **19 transducers** arranged in hexagonal pattern
- **1.3 cm spacing** between units (within skin spatial acuity limits)
- **Neck placement**: Worn on back of neck for intuitive spatial mapping
- **Flexible substrate**: Serpentine interconnects allow skin conformability
- **Wireless operation**: Bluetooth 5.0 controller with 500 mAh battery

### Electronic Architecture
- **Modular design**: Each transducer is independently addressable
- **H-bridge drivers**: Individual current control for each unit
- **Multiplexed sensing**: Single inductance measurement circuit serves all 19 units
- **Real-time processing**: nRF52840 processor handles sensor fusion and feedback generation

## Visual Navigation System Integration

### LiDAR-Based Spatial Mapping
The system uses smartphone LiDAR (iPhone 12 Pro) to create a real-time 3D understanding of the environment:

- **Scene reconstruction**: LiDAR continuously maps room geometry
- **Virtual detection zones**: 6 invisible "windows" positioned in 3D space around user
- **Configurable distance**: Detection zones set at user-defined distance (typically 2.5m)
- **Spatial anchoring**: IMU sensors track user position/orientation to maintain zone positions

### Detection Window Layout
The 6 virtual windows are arranged in a 2×3 grid pattern:
- **Top row**: Upper left, upper center, upper right
- **Bottom row**: Lower left, lower center, lower right
- **Coverage area**: Spans user's forward field of navigation
- **Real-time tracking**: Windows move with user orientation

### Haptic Feedback Mapping
When objects cross detection boundaries, specific haptic patterns are triggered:

**Spatial Encoding**:
- **Left column obstacles** → Wave pattern travels through left column of transducers
- **Center column obstacles** → Wave through center transducers  
- **Right column obstacles** → Wave through right transducers

**Vertical Encoding**:
- **Top row detection** → Wave travels bottom-to-top
- **Bottom row detection** → Wave travels top-to-bottom

**Pattern Characteristics**:
- **Wave speed**: Optimized for clear perception (~200ms duration)
- **Indentation depth**: Sufficient for reliable detection above threshold
- **Multiple objects**: System can handle simultaneous detections

## Data Flow and Processing Pipeline

### Real-Time Processing Chain
1. **LiDAR scanning** (30-60 Hz) → 3D point cloud generation
2. **Object detection** → Identification of obstacles crossing virtual boundaries
3. **Spatial classification** → Mapping obstacle location to 2×3 grid
4. **Pattern generation** → Converting spatial data to haptic wave patterns
5. **Bluetooth transmission** → Wireless communication to haptic array
6. **Local processing** → Array controller manages individual transducer activation
7. **Haptic rendering** → Sequential activation creates traveling wave sensation

### Sensor Fusion
- **LiDAR data**: Primary obstacle detection and distance measurement
- **IMU data**: User orientation and movement tracking for spatial anchoring
- **Haptic feedback**: Self-sensing for adaptive control and confirmation

## Performance Characteristics

### Technical Specifications
- **Detection range**: 0.5-4+ meters (configurable)
- **Spatial resolution**: 6 discrete zones with precise boundary detection
- **Response latency**: <100ms from detection to haptic feedback
- **Battery life**: 3+ hours continuous operation
- **Accuracy**: 81.8% obstacle identification accuracy in testing

### User Performance Results
In controlled testing with blindfolded participants:
