        <h2>Understanding Electrochemistry</h2>
        <p>Electrochemistry is a powerful tool to probe reactions involving electron transfers. It relates the flow of electrons to chemical changes, providing insights into reduction and oxidation processes of molecules.</p>
        
        <p>In electrochemical research, we can precisely control the driving force of a reaction by modulating the energy of electrons in an electrode. This control allows us to measure both thermodynamic and kinetic parameters with remarkable precision, making electrochemistry invaluable for catalysis research.</p>

        <h2>The Three-Electrode Configuration</h2>
        <p>Our electrochemical setup uses a three-electrode configuration, which has become the gold standard for accurate electrochemical measurements. This arrangement allows precise control of the potential at the working electrode while accurately measuring the resulting current.</p>
        
        <p>The separation of potential control and current measurement functions is what makes this system so powerful for investigating catalytic processes, reaction mechanisms, and material properties.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> Working Electrode (WE)</h3>
                <p>The working electrode is where the electrochemical event of interest occurs. Our setup uses <strong>FTO (Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide)</strong> as the working electrode, which offers several key advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transparent nature allows for simultaneous spectroscopic measurements</li>
                    <li>Provides an excellent conductive substrate for catalyst deposition</li>
                    <li>Exhibits stability across a wide potential window</li>
                    <li>Enables direct observation of catalyst layer changes during experiments</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The working electrode surface is carefully prepared before each experiment, as its condition directly affects measurement quality and reproducibility.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="electrode reference-electrode">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-compass"></i> Reference Electrode (RE)</h3>
                <p>The reference electrode has a well-defined and stable equilibrium potential. It functions as a reference point against which the potential of the working electrode is measured, without passing any significant current itself.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintains a consistent potential throughout the experiment</li>
                    <li>Is typically isolated from the main solution by a porous frit</li>
                    <li>Common types include Ag/AgCl, saturated calomel electrode (SCE), or Ag<sup>+</sup>/Ag couples</li>
                    <li>Enables precise control of the working electrode potential</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The stability of the reference electrode is crucial for obtaining reproducible and comparable results across experiments.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="electrode counter-electrode">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-exchange-alt"></i> Counter Electrode (CE)</h3>
                <p>The counter electrode completes the electrical circuit, allowing current to flow. When reduction occurs at the working electrode, oxidation happens at the counter electrode (and vice versa).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Typically has a larger surface area than the working electrode</li>
                    <li>Is made of inert materials like platinum, gold, or carbon</li>
                    <li>Should not limit the kinetics of the reaction being studied</li>
                    <li>May be separated by a frit if products generated could interfere with measurements</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The counter electrode ensures that the potentiostat can maintain the desired potential at the working electrode by allowing current to flow through the cell.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="potential-control fade-in">
        <h2>Controlling and Measuring Electrochemical Processes</h2>
        <p>The potentiostat connected to our cell controls the potential difference between the working and reference electrodes while measuring the resulting current between the working and counter electrodes.</p>
        
        <p>This separation of functions is critical because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It allows precise control of the electrode potential without being affected by the current passing through the cell</li>
            <li>The reference electrode potential remains stable as virtually no current passes through it</li>
            <li>The counter electrode can handle the current flow without affecting the potential measurement</li>
            <li>It enables quantitative analysis of electron transfer processes and reaction kinetics</li>
